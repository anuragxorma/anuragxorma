# Hi, I’m Anurag

**Welcome to my GitHub!** Here, I explore, build, and share projects that combine my passions for physics, machine learning, and data science. I’m a master’s student in **Astro and Particle Physics** with a growing focus on **Machine Learning** and **AI**, and I'm actively transitioning into a career as a Machine Learning Engineer or a Data Scientist.

## About Me

- Currently working on my thesis, **"BiPo Event Classification in OSIRIS using Machine Learning,"** where I’m developing multiple models to classify experimental events, achieving accuracies around 85%—significantly higher than the traditional 60% baseline.
- I’m improving my knowledge daily, taking specialized courses on **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning** and experimenting with various ML techniques.

## My Skills

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, C++, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Dask, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Optuna, Root, RootSorter  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, ANN, SimpleRNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, Attention Mechanisms  
- **Data Analysis & Management:** Data cleaning, time-series preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, scaling workflows with Dask  
- **Simulation & Robotics:** PyBullet, ROS2, MoveIt, trajectory planning and execution in simulated environments  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks, LaTeX  
- **Soft Skills:** Problem-solving, clear communication, structured thinking, rapid learning, remote collaboration
