# 👋 Hi, I’m Anurag

**Welcome to my GitHub!** Here, I explore, build, and share projects that combine my passions for physics, machine learning, and data science. I’m a master’s student in **Astro and Particle Physics** with a growing focus on **Machine Learning** and **AI**, and I'm actively transitioning into a career as a Machine Learning Engineer.

## 🌌 About Me

- 🔭 Currently working on my thesis, **"BiPo Event Classification in OSIRIS using Machine Learning,"** where I’m developing multiple models to classify experimental events, achieving accuracies around 80%—significantly higher than the traditional 60% baseline.
- 🌱 I’m improving my knowledge daily, taking specialized courses on **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning** and experimenting with various ML techniques.

## 🛠 My Skills
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Dask, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, ANN, RNN, LSTM
- **Data Analysis & Management:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation
- **Other Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 🎯 Goals
- **Short Term:** Gain industry experience through part-time or working student roles in AI/ML to complement my studies.
- **Long Term:** Transition fully into a Machine Learning Engineer role, where I can combine my technical skills with my interest in data-driven problem-solving.
